abstract: 'The following research questions were addressed in this study: 1. Is exposure to OSH risks, both in general and more specifically to environmental risks, risks of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and psychosocial risks (PSRs), as reported by employees, related to risk awareness and risk management in enterprises? 2. Are work-related health outcomes and well-being, as reported by employees, related to risk awareness and risk management in enterprises? 3. How well is risk management explained by exposure to work-related risks, both general and specific, and by work-related health outcomes, as reported by employees? 4. Do success factors, such as management commitment and levels of employee participation, or barriers, such as a lack of resources or expertise, explain the relationship between risk management at the enterprise level and the risk perception of employees? If so, what impact do these factors have? 5. Can a typology of enterprises be defined according to either the background of the enterprise (such as country, sector and size) or the main features of its OSH risk management approach, including its drivers and barriers?'
