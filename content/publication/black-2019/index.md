abstract: Critically, each of these investments requires that governments and stakeholders
  implement metrics to track their progress in achieving ECD-related targets and goals.
  National and global measurement of progress is of critical importance for ensuring
  and sustaining government commitment to global agendas and goals. In the context
  of ECD, most existing instruments for measuring ECD were developed in high-income
  countries.
