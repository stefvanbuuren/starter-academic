abstract: Valid estimates of caries experience are needed to monitor oral population
  health. Obtaining such estimates in practice is often complicated by nonresponse
  and missing data. The goal of this study was to estimate caries experiences in a
  population of children aged 5 and 11 years, in the presence of nonresponse and missing
  data. Four estimation methods are compared. Each method makes implicit assumptions
  about the processes that caused the nonresponse and the missing data. Three of the
  four methods are based on unrealistic assumptions about the missing data and underestimate
  caries experience. Under the missing at random assumption, multiple imputation in
  combination with direct standardization corrects for the deficiencies of current
  methodology. In the presence of missing data and nonresponse, we recommend a combination
  of multiple imputation and direct standardization to obtain correct estimates of
  caries experience.
