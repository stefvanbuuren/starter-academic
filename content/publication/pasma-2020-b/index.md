abstract: '**Background**: Intraoperative blood pressure has been suggested as a key factor
  for safe pediatric anesthesia. However, there is not much insight into factors that
  discriminate between children with low and normal pre‐incision blood pressure. Our
  aim was to explore whether children who have a low blood pressure during anesthesia
  are different than those with normal blood pressure. The focus of the present study
  was on the pre‐incision period. **Methods**: This retrospective study included pediatric
  patients undergoing anesthesia for non‐cardiac surgery at a tertiary pediatric university
  hospital, between 2012 and 2016. We analyzed the association between pre‐incision
  blood pressure and patient‐ and anesthesia characteristics, comparing low with normal
  pre‐incision blood pressure. This association was further explored with a multivariable
  linear regression. **Results**: In total, 20 962 anesthetic cases were included. Pre‐incision
  blood pressure was associated with age (beta −0.04 SD per year), gender (female
  −0.11), previous surgery (−0.15), preoperative blood pressure (+0.01 per mm Hg),
  epilepsy (0.12), bronchial hyperactivity (−0.18), emergency surgery (0.10), loco‐regional
  technique (−0.48), artificial airway device (supraglottic airway device instead
  of tube 0.07), and sevoflurane concentration (0.03 per sevoflurane %). **Conclusions**:
  Children with low pre‐incision blood pressure do not differ on clinically relevant
  factors from children with normal blood pressure. Although the present explorative
  study shows that pre‐incision blood pressure is partly dependent on patient characteristics
  and partly dependent on anesthetic technique, other unmeasured variables might play
  a more important role.'
