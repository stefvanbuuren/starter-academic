abstract: 'The goal of growth hormone (GH) treatment in a short child is to attain
  a fast catch-up growth toward the target height (TH) standard deviation score (SDS),
  followed by a maintenance phase, a proper pubertal height gain, and an adult height
  close to TH. The short-term response variable of GH treatment, first-year height
  velocity (HV) (cm/year or change in height SDS), can either be compared with GH
  response charts for diagnosis, age and gender, or with predicted HV based on prediction
  models. Three types of prediction models have been described: the Kabi International
  Growth Hormone Study models, the Gothenburg models and the Cologne model. With these
  models, 50-80% of the variance could be explained. When used prospectively, individualized
  dosing reduces the variation in growth response in comparison with a fixed dose
  per body weight. Insulin-like growth factor-I-based dose titration also led to a
  decrease in the variation. It is uncertain whether adding biochemical, genetic or
  proteomic markers may improve the accuracy of the prediction. Prediction models
  may lead to a more evidence-based approach to determine the GH dose regimen and
  may reduce the drug costs for GH treatment. There is a need for user-friendly software
  programs to make prediction models easily available in the clinic.'
