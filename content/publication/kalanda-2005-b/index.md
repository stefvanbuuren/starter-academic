abstract: 'Objective: To
  describe fetal growth centiles in relation to maternal malaria and HIV status, using
  cross sectional measurements at birth. Design: A cross sectional study of pregnant
  women and their babies. Data on maternal socioeconomic status and current pregnancy,
  including HIV status and newborn anthropometry, were collected. Malaria parasitaemia
  was assessed in maternal peripheral and placental blood, fetal haemoglobin was measured
  in cord blood, and maternal HIV status was determined. Setting: Two district hospitals
  in rural southern Malawi, between March 1993 and July 1994. Outcome variables: Newborn
  weight, length, Rohrerâ€™s ponderal index. Results: Maternal HIV (adjusted odds ratio
  (AOR) 1.76 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.98)) and first pregnancy (AOR 1.83
  (1.10 to 3.05)) were independently associated with low weight for age. Placental
  or peripheral parasifaemia at delivery (AOR 1.73 (1.02 to 2.88)) and primigravidae
  (AOR 2.13 (1.27 to 3.59)) were independently associated with low length for age.
  Maternal malaria at delivery and primiparity were associated with reduced newborn
  weight and length but not with disproportionate growth. Maternal HIV infection was
  associated only with reduced birth weight. The malaria and parity effect occurred
  throughout gestational weeks 30-40, but the HIV effect primarily after 38 weeks
  gestation. Conclusion: Fetal growth retardation in weight and length commonly occurs
  in this highly malarious area and is present from 30 weeks gestation. A maternal
  HIV effect on fetal weight occurred after 38 weeks gestation'
