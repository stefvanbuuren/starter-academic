abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Morbid obesity can be a life threatening condition. The aim
  of our study is to assess the trend in morbid obesity in The Netherlands among children
  of Dutch origin since 1980, and among children of Turkish and Moroccan origin since
  1997. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cross-sectional height and weight data of children of
  Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan origin aged 2-18 years were selected from three national
  Dutch Growth Studies performed in 1980, 1997 and 2009 (n = 54,814). Extended international
  (IOTF) cut-offs in childhood were used to define morbid obesity (obesity class II
  and III combined). The morbidity index for overweight was calculated as the prevalence
  of morbid obesity divided by the prevalence of overweight. Our study showed that
  the prevalence of morbid obesity in children of Dutch origin was 0.59% in boys and
  0.53% in girls in 2009. Significant upward trends occurred since 1980 and 1997.
  The prevalence was three to four fold higher in Turkish children compared to Dutch
  children. The Turkish children also had an upward trend since 1997, but this was
  only statistically significant in boys. The prevalence of morbid obesity in Moroccan
  children was two to three fold higher than in Dutch children, but it remained almost
  stable between 1997 and 2009. The Dutch and Turkish children showed an upward trend
  in morbidity index for overweight since respectively 1980 and 1997, while the Moroccan
  children showed a downward trend since 1997. In 2009, children of low educated parents
  had the highest prevalence rates of morbid obesity; 1.06% in Dutch, 2.11% in Turkish
  and 1.41% in Moroccan children. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: An upward trend of
  morbid obesity in Dutch and Turkish children in The Netherlands occurred. Monitoring
  and reducing the prevalence of childhood morbid obesity is of high importance for
  these children, health care and the community.'
