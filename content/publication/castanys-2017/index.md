abstract: Abstract We systematically reviewed papers published in English between
  1994 and October 2015 on how postnatal weight gain and growth affect neurodevelopment
  and metabolic outcomes in term‐born small‐for‐gestational‐age (SGA) infants. Two

  also increased fat mass, lean mass and blood pressure (BP), but had no effect on
  early neurocognitive …
