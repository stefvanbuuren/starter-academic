abstract: 'Abstract Background: People from Asian populations are generally shorter
  than other ethnic groups. It is unknown if current universal height references are
  suitable for affluent South Asian children in the Netherlands. Aims: To develop
  height-for-age charts for contemporary South Asian children aged 0-20 years living
  in the Netherlands, to evaluate secular trends, and to compare the charts with current
  Asian Indian, Dutch and WHO references. Subjects and methods: A population-based
  study measured 3315 South Asian children aged 0-20 years between 2007-2010. Among
  this cohort, 6876 measurements were taken. Another 7388 measurements were taken
  of a historical cohort of 1078 children born between 1974-1976 (aged 0-18 years).
  Results: An upward trend in height was observed for South Asian children living
  in the Netherlands between 1992-2010. The height-for-age charts of the South Asian
  historical cohort were similar to current Asian Indian charts. South Asian children
  in the Netherlands were shorter than their Dutch contemporaries at every age; and
  these differences increased further during adolescence. Compared to the WHO height-for-age
  references, there were considerable discrepancies in height, with curves intersecting
  twice. Conclusion: The discrepancies between the South Asian and Dutch and WHO height-for-age
  references indicate differences in growth patterns between the source populations.'
