abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Insights into the effects of energy balance-related parenting
  practices on children’s diet and activity behavior at an early age is warranted
  to determine which practices should be recommended and to whom. The purpose of this
  study was to examine child and parent background correlates of energy balance-related
  parenting practices at age 5, as well as the associations of these practices with
  children’s diet, activity behavior, and body mass index (BMI) development. METHODS:
  Questionnaire data originated from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study for ages 5 (N =
  2026) and 7 (N = 1819). Linear regression analyses were used to examine the association
  of child and parent background characteristics with parenting practices (i.e., diet-
  and activity-related restriction, monitoring and stimulation), and to examine the
  associations between these parenting practices and children’s diet (in terms of
  energy intake, dietary fiber intake, and added sugar intake) and activity behavior
  (i.e., physical activity and sedentary time) at age 5, as well as BMI development
  from age 5 to age 7. Moderation analyses were used to examine whether the associations
  between the parenting practices and child behavior depended on child characteristics.
  RESULTS: Several child and parent background characteristics were associated with
  the parenting practices. Dietary monitoring, stimulation of healthy intake and stimulation
  of physical activity were associated with desirable energy balance-related behaviors
  (i.e., dietary intake and/or activity behavior) and desirable BMI development, whereas
  restriction of sedentary time showed associations with undesirable behaviors and
  BMI development. Child eating style and weight status, but not child gender or activity
  style, moderated the associations between parenting practices and behavior. Dietary
  restriction and monitoring showed weaker, or even undesirable associations for children
  with a deviant eating style, whereas these practices showed associations with desirable
  behavior for normal eaters. By contrast, stimulation to eat healthy worked particularly
  well for children with a deviant eating style or a high BMI. CONCLUSION: Although
  most energy balance-related parenting practices were associated with desirable behaviors,
  some practices showed associations with undesirable child behavior and weight outcomes.
  Only parental stimulation showed desirable associations with regard to both diet
  and activity behavior. The interaction between parenting and child characteristics
  in the association with behavior calls for parenting that is tailored to the individual
  child. JID: 101217089; OID: NLM: PMC3065396; 2010/07/26 [received]; 2011/03/14 [accepted];
