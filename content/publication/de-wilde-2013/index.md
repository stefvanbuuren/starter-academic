abstract: 'BACKGROUND: South Asian babies born in developed countries are generally
  lighter than babies from other ethnic groups born in the same country. While the
  mean birth weight of Caucasian babies in the Netherlands has increased the past
  decades, it is unknown if the mean birth weight of South Asian babies born in the
  Netherlands has increased or if the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) or small-for-gestational-age
  (SGA) has decreased.The aims of this study are: 1. to investigate secular changes
  in mean birth weight and the prevalence of LBW and SGA in Surinamese South Asian
  babies, and 2. to assess differences between Surinamese South Asian and Dutch Caucasian
  neonates born 2006-2009. METHODS: A population based study for which neonatal characteristics
  of 2014 Surinamese South Asian babies, born between 1974 and 2009 in the Netherlands,
  and 3104 Dutch Caucasian babies born 2006-2009 were obtained from well-baby clinic
  records. LBW was defined as a birth weight <2500 g. SGA was based on a universal
  population standard (the Netherlands) and three ethnic specific standards (the Netherlands,
  UK, Canada). RESULTS: In Surinamese South Asian babies from 1974 to 2009 no secular
  trend in mean birth weight and prevalence of LBW was found, whereas SGA prevalence
  decreased significantly.Surinamese South Asian babies born in 2006-2009 (2993 g;
  95% CI 2959-3029 g) were 450 g lighter than Dutch Caucasian babies (3448 g; 95%
  CI 3429-3468 g), while LBW and SGA prevalences, based on universal standards, were
  three times higher. Application of ethnic specific standards from the Netherlands
  and the UK yielded SGA rates in Surinamese South Asian babies that were similar
  to Dutch. There were considerable differences between the standards used. CONCLUSION:
  Since 1974, although the mean birth weight of Surinamese South Asian babies remained
  unchanged, they gained a healthier weight for their gestational age.'
