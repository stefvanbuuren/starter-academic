abstract: 'Introduction: Infant growth has not been studied in developing countries in relation to maternal factors related
  to malaria in pregnancy and maternal illiteracy. Objective: To describe growth patterns
  in infants with low and normal birthweight and determine maternal risk factors for
  infant undernutrition. Methods: Babies born in a rural district of southern Malawi
  were recruited. An infant cohort was selected on the basis of low or normal birthweight.
  Weight and length were recorded at birth and at 4-weekly intervals until at 52 weeks
  after birth. Maternal characteristics at first antenatal attendance and delivery
  were obtained. Odds ratios in univariate analysis were adjusted for birthweight.
  Factors included in the multivariate regression included maternal illiteracy, season
  of birth, maternal iron deficiency and number of infant illness episodes. Results:
  Low birthweight infants were shorter and lighter throughout infancy than either
  normal birthweight or international reference values. At 12 months, placental or
  peripheral malaria at delivery (adjusted odds 1.8; 1.0, 3.1), number of infant illness
  episodes (AOR = 2.1; 1.2, 3.6) and maternal illiteracy (AOR = 2.7; 1.5, 4.9) were
  independently associated with low weight for age. Maternal short stature (AOR =
  1.8; 1.1. 3.2), male sex (AOR = 2.4; 1.4, 4.1), number of infant illness episodes
  (AOR = 2.6; 1.5, 4.4), and birth in the rainy season (2.1; 1.2, 3.7) were independently
  associated with stunting. Placental or peripheral malaria at delivery (AOR = 2.2;
  1.1, 4.4) and number of illness episodes (AOR = 2.2; 1.1, 4.5) were independently
  associated with thinness. Conclusion: Malaria during pregnancy and maternal illiteracy
  are important maternal characteristics associated with infant undernutrition. Innovative
  health/literacy strategies are required to address malaria control in pregnancy
  in order to reduce the magnitude of its effects on infant undernutrition.'
