abstract: 'In multiple imputation (MI), the resulting estimates are consistent if
  the imputation model is correct. To specify the imputation model, it is recommended
  to combine two sets of variables: those that are related to the incomplete variable
  and those that are related to the missingness mechanism. Several possibilities exist,
  but it is not clear how they perform in practice. The method that simply groups
  all variables together into the imputation model and four other methods that are
  based on the propensity scores are presented. Two of them are new and have not been
  used in the context of MI. The performance of the methods is investigated by a simulation
  study under different missing at random mechanisms for different types of variables.
  We conclude that all methods, except for one method based on the propensity scores,
  perform well. It turns out that as long as the relevant variables are taken into
  the imputation model, the form of the imputation model has only a minor effect in
  the quality of the imputations.; In multiple imputation (MI), the resulting estimates
