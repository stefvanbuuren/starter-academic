abstract: 'Objective: Many health-promoting interventions combine multiple behavior
  change techniques (BCTs) to maximize effectiveness. Although, in theory, BCTs can
  amplify each other, the available meta-analyses have not been able to identify specific
  combinations of techniques that provide synergistic effects. This study overcomes
  some of the shortcomings in the current methodology by applying classification and
