abstract: 'Background/Aims: Childhood stunting is a prevalent problem in low-and middle-income
  countries and is associated with long-term adverse neurodevelopment and health outcomes.
  In this review, we define indicators of growth, discuss key challenges in their
  analysis and application, and offer suggestions for indicator selection in clinical
  research contexts. Methods: Critical review of the literature. Results: Linear growth
  is commonly expressed as length-for-age or height-for-age z-score (HAZ) in comparison
  to normative …'
