abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Studies regarding the association of child-care use with body
  mass index (BMI), overweight or obesity development show contradictory results.
  This study examined the relationship between child-care use and BMI z-scores and
  overweight, as well as associates of child-care use in children up to 2 years old.
  METHODS: Longitudinal data originated from the Dutch KOALA Birth Cohort Study. Questionnaires
  assessed child-care use at ages 7 months and 1 and 2 years (N=2396). Height and
  weight assessed at 1 and 2 years were used to calculate BMI z-scores. Overweight
  was defined as a BMI z-score of >/=85th percentile. The influence of child-care
  use on weight development was tested using backward linear and logistic regression
  analyses. Outcomes were: (1) BMI z-score at 1 and 2 years; (2) change in BMI z-score
  between 1 and 2 years; (3) overweight vs non-overweight at 1 and 2 years; and (4)
  change from normal weight to overweight vs remaining normal weight between 1 and
  2 years. The association between child-care use and parental background characteristics
  was tested using backward logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Child-care use
  (no/yes) at 1 and 2 years positively predicted BMI z-scores at age 2 years, as well
  as change in BMI z-score between 1 and 2 years. These associations were adjusted
  for various covariates (for example, parental working hours). Furthermore, child-care
  use significantly increased the odds of being overweight at age 1 year. There were
  few differences in BMI or overweight between intensive (>16 h per week) and limited
  child-care use (</=16 h). Child-care use was positively associated with various
  parental characteristics, including parental working hours and maternal educational
  level. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a small influence of child-care use on weight
  development in very young children. The child-care setting could have an important
  role in preventive interventions against overweight and obesity development in young
  children. JID: 101256108; 2010/05/25 [aheadofprint]; ppublish'
