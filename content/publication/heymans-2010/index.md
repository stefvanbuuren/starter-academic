abstract: 'BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The recovery of patients with chronic low back pain
  (LBP) is slow. Furthermore, it is recently proposed that chronic LBP needs a prognostic
  approach to determine who will develop clinically significant back pain. Therefore,
  it is imperative to identify prognostic factors that are mostly seen in chronic
  LBP patients at an early stage. This may give clinicians tailored advice to prevent
  chronicity or may refer to a specific intervention. PURPOSE: To investigate the
  contribution of demographic, work, clinical, and psychosocial variables, including
  new prognostic variables as changes in pain intensity and disability status, on
  the development of chronic LBP. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective cohort data by
  merging data from three randomized trials (secondary analyses). PATIENT SAMPLE:
  Workers (n=628) on sick leave because of subacute nonspecific LBP. OUTCOME MEASURES:
  Chronic LBP for longer than 6 months (functional measure). METHODS: Potential prognostic
  variables were demographic, work, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics (self-report
  measures). We also included as prognostic variables a clinically relevant change
  in pain intensity and disability status. For the selection of variables and prognostic
  models, bootstrapping techniques were used in combination with multivariable logistic
  regression. The explained variance and discrimination were used to evaluate the
  clinical performance of the models. RESULTS: The variables most strongly related
  to chronic LBP were as follows: no clinically relevant change in pain intensity
  and in disability status in the first 3 months, a higher pain intensity score at
  baseline, and a higher score for kinesiophobia. This prognostic model had a bootstrap-corrected
  explained variance of 37% and a discriminative ability (c index) of 0.80. CONCLUSIONS:
  Clinical-, work-, and psychosocial-related variables contribute to the development
  of chronic LBP. The most promising variables are a clinically relevant decrease
  in pain intensity and in disability status in the first 3 months. These variables
  are relevant for clinicians to advise their patients with respect to preventive
  measures or treatment strategies. CI: Copyright (c) 2010; JID: 101130732; 2009/01/28
