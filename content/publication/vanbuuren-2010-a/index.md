abstract: 'Exclusively breastfed (EBF) infants have higher weight gain during the
  first 2 months, and lower thereafter. The explanation for this phenomenon is not
  clear. Longitudinal data from the Social Medical Survey of Children Attending Child
  Health Clinics study with a cohort of 2,151 Dutch children were analyzed according
  to a pattern mixture model. It appears that higher than average growth of EBF infants
  during the first 2 months is primarily attributable to selective dropout. Furthermore,
  between months 2 and 6, light nonEBF infants gain more weight than light EBF infants.
  Both factors aid in explaining differences in growth between EBF and nonEBF infants.
  The WHO Child Growth Standards for weight-for-age have been calculated from a subgroup
  of 903 infants (out of 1,743) that complied with strict feeding criteria. If similar
  dropout mechanisms operate in the Multicentre Growth Reference Study, then the WHO
  weight-for-age standards are expected to be systematically different from those
  for the entire group of 1,743 infants. CI: Copyright (c) 2010; JID: 101244056; 2010/02/01
