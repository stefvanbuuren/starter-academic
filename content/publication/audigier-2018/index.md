abstract: We present and compare multiple imputation methods for mul- tilevel continuous
  and binary data where variables are systematically and sporadically missing. The
  methods are compared from a theoretical point of view and through an extensive simulation
  study motivated by a real dataset comprising multiple studies. The comparisons show
  that these multiple imputation methods are the most appropriate to handle missing
  values in a multilevel setting and why their relative performances can vary according
  to the missing data pattern, the multilevel structure and the type of missing variables.
  This study shows that valid inferences can only be obtained if the dataset includes
  a large number of clusters. In addition, it highlights that heteroscedastic multiple
  imputation methods provide more accurate inferences than homoscedastic methods,
  which should be reserved for data with few individuals per cluster. Finally, guidelines
  are given to choose the most suitable multiple imputation method according to the
  structure of the data.
