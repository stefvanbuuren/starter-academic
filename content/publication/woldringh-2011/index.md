abstract: 'Birth weight and longitudinal growth in the first 4 years of life of term
  singletons conceived with the use of IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
  were compared with those of naturally conceived singletons. Although IVF and ICSI
  singletons had a statistically significantly lower birth weight than naturally conceived
  singletons, the average individual weight curves showed that this difference was
  lost before the age of 4 years in all subgroups: IVF, ICSI, boys, and girls. CI:
