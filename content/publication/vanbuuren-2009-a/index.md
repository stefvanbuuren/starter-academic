abstract: 'Regional or national growth distributions can provide vital information
  on the health status of populations. In most resource poor countries, however, the
  required anthropometric data from purpose-designed growth surveys are not readily
  available. We propose a practical method for estimating regional (multi-country)
  age-conditional weight distributions based on existing survey data from different
  countries. We developed a two-step method by which one is able to model data with
  widely different age ranges and sample sizes. The method produces references both
  at the country level and at the regional (multi-country) level. The first step models
  country-specific centile curves by Box-Cox t and Box-Cox power exponential distributions
  implemented in generalized additive model for location, scale and shape through
  a common model. Individual countries may vary in location and spread. The second
  step defines the regional reference from a finite mixture of the country distributions,
  weighted by population size. To demonstrate the method we fitted the weight-for-age
  distribution of 12 countries in South East Asia and the Western Pacific, based on
  273 270 observations. We modeled both the raw body weight and the corresponding
  Z score, and obtained a good fit between the final models and the original data
  for both solutions. We briefly discuss an application of the generated regional
  references to obtain appropriate, region specific, age-based dosing regimens of
  drugs used in the tropics. The method is an affordable and efficient strategy to
  estimate regional growth distributions where the standard costly alternatives are
  not an option. CI: Copyright (c) 2009; GR: 5U01/CI 000321/CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United
