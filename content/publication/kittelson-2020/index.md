abstract: '**BACKGROUND**: Clinicians and patients lack an evidence-based framework by
  which to judge individual-level recovery following total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
  surgery, thus impeding personalized treatment approaches for this elective surgery.
  Our study aimed to develop and validate a reference chart for monitoring recovery
  of knee flexion following TKA surgery. **METHODS**: Retrospective analysis of data collected
  in routine rehabilitation practice for patients following TKA surgery. Reference
  charts were constructed using Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and
  Shape. Various models were compared using the Schwarz Bayesian Criterion, Mean Squared
  Error in 5-fold cross validation, and centile coverage (i.e. the percent of observed
  data represented below specified centiles). The performance of the reference chart
  was then validated against a test set of patients with later surgical dates, by
  examining the centile coverage and average bias (i.e. difference between observed
  and predicted values) in the test dataset. **RESULTS**: A total of 1173 observations
  from 327 patients were used to develop a reference chart for knee flexion over the
  first 120 days following TKA. The best fitting model utilized a non-linear time
  trend, with smoothing splines for median and variance parameters. Additionally,
  optimization of the number of knots in smoothing splines and power transformation
  of time improved model fit. The reference chart performed adequately in a test set
  of 171 patients (377 observations), with accurate centile coverage and minimal average
  bias (<3 degrees). **CONCLUSION**: A reference chart developed with clinically collected
  data offers a new approach to monitoring knee flexion following TKA.'
