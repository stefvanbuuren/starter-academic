abstract: 'Growth and body height have always been topics interesting to the public.
  In particular, the stupendous increase of some 15-19cm in final adult height during
  the last 150 years in most European countries (the “secular trend”), the concomitant
  changes in body and head proportions, the tendency towards early onset of sexual
  maturation, the changes in the age when final height is being reached, and the very
  recent trend in body mass index, have generated much scientific literature. The
  marked plasticity of growth in height and weight over time causes problems. Child
  growth references differ between nations, they tend to quickly become out of date,
  and raise a number of questions regarding fitting methods, effects caused by selective
  drop-out, etc. New findings contradict common beliefs about the primary importance
  of nutritional and health related factors for secular changes in growth. There appears
  to be a broad age span from mid-childhood to early adolescence that is characterised
  by a peculiar insusceptibility. Environmental factors that are known to influence
  growth during this age span appear to have only little or no impact on final height.
  Major re-arrangements in height occur at an age when puberty has almost been completed
  and final height has almost been reached, implying that factors, which drive the
  secular trend in height, are limited to early childhood and late adolescence. JID:
