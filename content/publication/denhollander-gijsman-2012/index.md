abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Clark and Watson developed the tripartite model in which a
  symptom dimension of ‘negative affect’ covers common psychological distress that
  is typically seen in anxious and depressed patients. The ‘positive affect’ and ‘somatic
  arousal’ dimensions cover more specific symptoms. Although the model has met much
  support, it does not cover all relevant anxiety symptoms and its negative affect
  dimension is rather unspecific. Therefore, we aimed to extend the tripartite model
  in order to describe more specific symptom patterns with unidimensional measurement
  scales. METHOD: 1333 outpatients provided self report data. To develop an extended
  factor model, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted in one part of the
  data (n=578). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted in the second part
  (n=755), to assess model-fit and comparison with other models. Rasch analyses were
  done to investigate the unidimensionality of the factors. RESULTS: EFA resulted
  in a 6-factor model: feelings of worthlessness, fatigue, somatic arousal, anxious
  apprehension, phobic fear and tension. CFA in the second sample showed that a 6-factor
  model with a hierarchical common severity factor fits the data better than alternative
  1- and 3-factor models. Rasch analyses showed that each of the factors and the total
  of factors can be regarded as unidimensional measurement scales. LIMITATIONS: The
  model is based on a restricted symptom-pool: more dimensions are likely to exist.
  CONCLUSION: The extended tripartite model describes the clinical state of patients
  more specifically. This is relevant for both clinical practice and research. CI:
