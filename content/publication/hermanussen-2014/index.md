abstract: The association between poverty, malnutrition, illness and poor socioeconomic
  conditions on the one side, and poor growth and short adult stature on the other
  side, is well recognized. Yet, the simple assumption by implication that poor growth
  and short stature result from poor living conditions, should be questioned. Recent
  evidence on the impact of the social network on adolescent growth and adult height
  further challenges the traditional concept of growth being a mirror of health. Twenty-nine
  scientists met at Glucksburg castle, Northern Germany, November 15th - 17th 2013,
  to discuss genetic, endocrine, mathematical and psychological aspects and related
  issues, of child and adolescent growth and final height.
