abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of breast-feeding
  on the development of childhood overweight are unclear. This study examines the
  association of breast-feeding with weight gain in the first year, and body mass
  index (BMI) and overweight up to 4 years. In addition, we examine possible mechanisms
  of this effect (i.e., feeding pattern, eating style, unhealthy snacking behavior).
  METHODS: Data originated from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study (N = 2 834). Questionnaires
  assessed breast-feeding duration up to 12 months, feeding pattern (i.e., feeding
  on demand or feeding to schedule) at 3 months, BMI at 1, 2 and 4 years, eating style
  (e.g., slow eating) at age 1, and unhealthy snacking at age 2. Linear and logistic
  regression analyses were used to examine the association of breast-feeding and feeding
  pattern with eating style, unhealthy snacking, BMI z-scores and overweight. RESULTS:
  Each additional month of breast-feeding was associated with less weight gain in
  the first year (regression coefficient B = -37.6 g, p < 0.001), a lower BMI z-score
  at age 1 (B = -0.02, p < 0.01), and a lower odds of being overweight at age 1 (odds
  ratio = 0.96, p < 0.05). Breast-feeding was associated with fewer unhealthy snacking
  occasions per week at age 2 (B = -0.19 for each month of breast-feeding, p < 0.001),
  but was unrelated to eating style. Feeding pattern was unrelated to all outcome
  variables after adjustment for breast-feeding duration. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed
  a short-term protective effect of breast-feeding against overweight development.
  Possible mechanisms through which breast-feeding may protect against overweight
  include less unhealthy snacking behavior, but not feeding pattern or childâ€™s eating
  style. JID: 101256330; 2010/09/22 [aheadofprint]; ppublish'
