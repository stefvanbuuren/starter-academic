abstract: This article reviews and compares two types of growth charts for tracking
  human development over age. Both charts assume the existence of a continuous latent
  variable, but relate to the observed data in different ways. The D-score diagram
  summarizes developmental indicators into a single aggregate score measuring global
  development. The relations between the indicators should be consistent with the
  Rasch model. If true, the D-score is a measure with interval scale properties, and
  allows for the calculation of meaningful differences both within and across age.
  The stage line diagram describes the natural development of ordinal indicators.
  The method models the transition probabilities between successive stages of the
  indicator as smoothly varying functions of age. The location of each stage is quantified
  by the mid-P-value. Both types of diagrams assist in identifying early and delayed
  development, as well as finding differences in tempo. The relevant techniques are
  illustrated to track global development during infancy and early childhood (0-2
  years) and Tanner pubertal stages (8-21 years). New reference values for both applications
  are provided.
