abstract: 'This paper deals with problems concerning missing data in statistical databases.
  Multiple imputation is a statistically sound technique for handling incomplete data.
  Two problems should be addressed before the routine application of the technique
  becomes feasible. First, if imputations are to be appropriate for more than one
  statistical analysis, they should be generated independently of any scientific models
  that are to be applied to the data at a later stage. This is done by finding imputations
  that will extrapolate the structure of the data, as well as the uncertainty about
  this structure. A second problem is to use complete-data methods in an efficient
  way. The HERMES workstation encapsulates existing statistical packages in a client-server
  model. It forms a natural and convenient environment for implementing multiple imputation.'
