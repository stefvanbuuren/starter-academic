abstract: Gestational weight gain differs according to pre-pregnancy body mass index
  and is related to the risks of adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Gestational
  weight gain charts for women in different pre-pregnancy body mass index groups enable
  identification of women and offspring at risk for adverse health outcomes. We aimed
  to construct gestational weight gain reference charts for underweight, normal weight,
  overweight, and grades 1, 2 and 3 obese women and to compare these charts with those
  obtained in women with uncomplicated term pregnancies.
