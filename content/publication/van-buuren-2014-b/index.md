abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To develop a reference chart to monitor inspiratory muscle
  strength during pre-operative inspiratory muscle training for patients at high risk
  of developing postoperative pulmonary complications awaiting coronary artery bypass
  graft (CABG) surgery. DESIGN: Secondary data analysis using patients from the intervention
  arm of a randomised clinical trial. SETTING: University medical centre. PARTICIPANTS:
  Patients at high risk of developing postoperative pulmonary complications awaiting
  CABG surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients performed inspiratory muscle training seven
  times per week for at least 2 weeks before surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maximal
  inspiratory muscle strength. RESULTS: A new reference chart was produced using a
  non-linear time trend model with a normal error structure. CONCLUSIONS: The chart
  is a novel tool for monitoring the progress of inspiratory muscle training for physiotherapy
  practice. Wider use of this chart is recommended.'
