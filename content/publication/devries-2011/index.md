abstract: 'PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate two artificial neural network (ANN) models
  based on single-sensor accelerometer data and an ANN model based on the data of
  two accelerometers for the identification of types of physical activity in adults.
  METHODS: Forty-nine subjects (21 men and 28 women; age range = 22-62 yr) performed
  a controlled sequence of activities: sitting, standing, using the stairs, and walking
  and cycling at two self-paced speeds. All subjects wore an ActiGraph accelerometer
  on the hip and the ankle. In the ANN models, the following accelerometer signal
  characteristics were used: 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, absolute deviation,
  coefficient of variability, and lag-one autocorrelation. RESULTS: The model based
  on the hip accelerometer data and the model based on the ankle accelerometer data
  correctly classified the five activities 80.4% and 77.7% of the time, respectively,
  whereas the model based on the data from both sensors achieved a percentage of 83.0%.
  The hip model produced a better classification of the activities cycling, using
  the stairs, and sitting, whereas the ankle model was better able to correctly classify
  the activities walking and standing still. All three models often misclassified
  using the stairs and standing still. The accuracy of the models significantly decreased
  when a distinction was made between regular versus brisk walking or cycling and
  between going up and going down the stairs. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively simple ANN models
  perform well in identifying the type but not the speed of the activity of adults
  from accelerometer data. JID: 8005433; ppublish'
