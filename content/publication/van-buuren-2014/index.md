abstract: There are very few norms to evaluate and monitor the health and functioning
  of the elderly. This paper proposes a compact spatial representation of 25 health
  measurements of European citizens older than 50 years. Data from 44,285 unique individuals
  were obtained from the EU-wide Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe(SHARE)
  data collected in 2004-2007 and were analyzed by homogeneity analysis, a form of
  non-linear principal components analysis. The resulting configuration of persons
  shows a remarkable three-dimensional shape that resembles a fountain. The three
  components explain 13.7, 5.8 and 4.6 percent of the total variation, respectively.
  Component 1 is driven by age and by the disabilities that come with old age. Component
  2 portrays differences in health that are independent of age, with the high scores
  in relatively good health, given age. Component 3 distinguishes specific types of
  functional decline from general complaints that impact on daily life. The shape
  suggests that the elderly keep on maturing as they grow older, actually becoming
  more diverse as a group. We show how the solution may be used to develop and support
  profiles for the elderly. Another potential application is to track the individual
  development of the elderly, thereby objectifying personalized medicine.
