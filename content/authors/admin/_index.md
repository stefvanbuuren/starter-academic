Stef van Buuren is *Professor of Statistical Analysis of Incomplete Data* at the University of Utrecht and *Principal Scientist* at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO in Leiden. His interests include the analysis of incomplete data, child growth and development, computational statistics, measurement and individual causal effects. 

Van Buuren is the inventor of the *MICE algorithm* for multiple imputation of missing data. He created the *growth charts* used in the Dutch child health care system, and designed the *D-score*, a new system for expressing child development on a quantitative scale. He consults for the World Health Organization and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
